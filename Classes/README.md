# Readme First

In all these samples I used `flow` types so in order to see it properly you need to install `flow` globally, you can get it using npm:

```cmd
npm i -g flow-bin
```

Also first install all the dependencies using `npm` and run with `babel-node` command, for example I can run one script using the next command:

```cmd
node_modules\.bin\babel-node src/class-like-structure.js
```

In the above example I used the local `babel-node` command to run the script but If you have installed `babel-cli` globally you can run the past command just using `babel-node` without the path
